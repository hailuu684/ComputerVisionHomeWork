# ComputerVisionHomeWork
Each branch consists of one task of the homework

The contribution of the work

Task 1: Luu Tung Hai and Abdul Rehman Shah implemented the flow work of the YOLOv4, we have to label images again because of the limitation in coding, also in the annotation .txt file, it consists of 3D coordinates and using API's yolov4 requires only classes( car:1, pedestrian:2,..) and 2D coordinates.

Task 2: We are trying to extract the x,y and z coordinates from the depth images. However, we still cannot figure it out how to apply methods for this task

Task 3: Luu Tung Hai and Abdul Rehman Shah implemented some networks, metrics, then we compared and chose the best results.

Task 4: In this task, we proposed 2 methods

 Luu Tung Hai and Abdul Rehman Shah implemented Ransac algorithm. 
 
 Ahmed implemented some transformations using Opencv functions( used filters like Sobel operator and color space thresholding and histogram and sliding windows for line detection and prediction and lane curvature calculations)
