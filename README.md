Each branch consists of one task of the homework

The contribution of the work

Task 1: Luu Tung Hai and Abdul Rehman Shah implemented the flow work of the YOLOv4, we have to label images again because of the limitation in coding, also in the annotation .txt file, it consists of 3D coordinates and using API's yolov4 requires only classes( car:1, pedestrian:2,..) and 2D coordinates.

Task 3: Luu Tung Hai and Abdul Rehman Shah implemented some networks, metrics, then we compared and chose the best results.

Task 4: In this task, we proposed 2 methods

 Luu Tung Hai and Abdul Rehman Shah implemented Ransac algorithm. 
 
 Ahmed suggeseted HSV color system. Only can extract the road with a number of trials using a track bar, but it is not really an algorithm to estimate the freespace automatically, so we did not use it in the final version.
